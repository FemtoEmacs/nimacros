abstract:
   This work assumes that the reader already knows how to program
   and is familiar with command line tools. Therefore, as
   far as programming goes, the only subject that the author
   discusses is macro designing.
   
   If you are not interested in anything besides the Nim language
   and macro design, the author recommends that you don't go
   beyond page 30, and thus avoiding material that you may consider
   offensive.
